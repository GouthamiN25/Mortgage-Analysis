# üè†Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing a large dataset of U.S. consumer mortgage complaints sourced from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). By applying data science techniques, the goal is to identify key complaint trends, understand consumer pain points, and support actionable insights for improving customer service in the mortgage industry.

# üìä Project Description
This notebook presents a comprehensive analysis of over 500,000 consumer mortgage complaint records using Python tools like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The project covers:

- Data preparation and cleaning

- In-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Identification of complaint trends by type, company, and region

- Analysis of complaint frequency over time

- Regression modeling to examine factors affecting response time

The insights gained from this analysis aim to help mortgage service providers better understand customer concerns and improve their response strategies.
